# PNNL computing capabilities


## PNNL computing landscape
This directory includes various hacks of [D3](http://d3js.org/) examples to illustrate PNNL computing capabilities.  Unless otherwise noted, sizes of visualization elements represent overall PNNL strength/capabilities in an area.

## Caveats
