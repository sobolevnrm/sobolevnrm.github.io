                <div class="summary"><p>Real-world observable physical and chemical characteristics are increasingly being calculated from the 3D structures of biomolecules. Methods for calculating pK(a) values, binding constants of ligands, and changes in protein stability are readily available, but often the limiting step in computational biology is the conversion of PDB structures into formats ready for use with biomolecular simulation software. The continued sophistication and integration of biomolecular simulation methods for systems- and genome-wide studies requires a fast, robust, physically realistic and standardized protocol for preparing macromolecular structures for biophysical algorithms. As described previously, the PDB2PQR web server addresses this need for electrostatic field calculations (Dolinsky et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 32, W665-W667, 2004). Here we report the significantly expanded PDB2PQR that includes the following features: robust standalone command line support, improved pK(a) estimation via the PROPKA framework, ligand parameterization via PEOE_PB charge methodology, expanded set of force fields and easily incorporated user-defined parameters via XML input files, and improvement of atom addition and optimization code. These features are available through a new web interface (http://pdb2pqr.sourceforge.net/), which offers users a wide range of options for PDB file conversion, modification and parameterization.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>Modeling the change in the electrostatics of organic molecules upon moving from vacuum into solvent, due to polarization, has long been an interesting problem. In vacuum, experimental values for the dipole moments and polarizabilities of small, rigid molecules are known to high accuracy; however, it has generally been difficult to determine these quantities for a polar molecule in water. A theoretical approach introduced by Onsager [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 58, 1486 (1936)] used vacuum properties of small molecules, including polarizability, dipole moment, and size, to predict experimentally known permittivities of neat liquids via the Poisson equation. Since this important advance in understanding the condensed phase, a large number of computational methods have been developed to study solutes embedded in a continuum via numerical solutions to the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Only recently have the classical force fields used for studying biomolecules begun to include explicit polarization in their functional forms. Here the authors describe the theory underlying a newly developed polarizable multipole Poisson-Boltzmann (PMPB) continuum electrostatics model, which builds on the atomic multipole optimized energetics for biomolecular applications (AMOEBA) force field. As an application of the PMPB methodology, results are presented for several small folded proteins studied by molecular dynamics in explicit water as well as embedded in the PMPB continuum. The dipole moment of each protein increased on average by a factor of 1.27 in explicit AMOEBA water and 1.26 in continuum solvent. The essentially identical electrostatic response in both models suggests that PMPB electrostatics offers an efficient alternative to sampling explicit solvent molecules for a variety of interesting applications, including binding energies, conformational analysis, and pK(a) prediction. Introduction of 150 mM salt lowered the electrostatic solvation energy between 2 and 13 kcalmole, depending on the formal charge of the protein, but had only a small influence on dipole moments.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>The solvent reaction field potential of an uncharged protein immersed in simple point charge/extended explicit solvent was computed over a series of molecular dynamics trajectories, in total 1560 ns of simulation time. A finite, positive potential of 13-24 kbTec(-1) (where T=300 K), dependent on the geometry of the solvent-accessible surface, was observed inside the biomolecule. The primary contribution to this potential arose from a layer of positive charge density 1.0 A from the solute surface, on average 0.008 ec/A3, which we found to be the product of a highly ordered first solvation shell. Significant second solvation shell effects, including additional layers of charge density and a slight decrease in the short-range solvent-solvent interaction strength, were also observed. The impact of these findings on implicit solvent models was assessed by running similar explicit solvent simulations on the fully charged protein system. When the energy due to the solvent reaction field in the uncharged system is accounted for, correlation between per-atom electrostatic energies for the explicit solvent model and a simple implicit (Poisson) calculation is 0.97, and correlation between per-atom energies for the explicit solvent model and a previously published, optimized Poisson model is 0.99.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>Continuum solvation models provide appealing alternatives to explicit solvent methods because of their ability to reproduce solvation effects while alleviating the need for expensive sampling. Our previous work has demonstrated that Poisson-Boltzmann methods are capable of faithfully reproducing polar explicit solvent forces for dilute protein systems; however, the popular solvent-accessible surface area model was shown to be incapable of accurately describing nonpolar solvation forces at atomic-length scales. Therefore, alternate continuum methods are needed to reproduce nonpolar interactions at the atomic scale. In the present work, we address this issue by supplementing the solvent-accessible surface area model with additional volume and dispersion integral terms suggested by scaled particle models and Weeks-Chandler-Andersen theory, respectively. This more complete nonpolar implicit solvent model shows very good agreement with explicit solvent results and suggests that, although often overlooked, the inclusion of appropriate dispersion and volume terms are essential for an accurate implicit solvent description of atomic-scale nonpolar forces.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>Continuum solvation models, such as Poisson-Boltzmann and Generalized Born methods, have become increasingly popular tools for investigating the influence of electrostatics on biomolecular structure, energetics and dynamics. However, the use of such methods requires accurate and complete structural data as well as force field parameters such as atomic charges and radii. Unfortunately, the limiting step in continuum electrostatics calculations is often the addition of missing atomic coordinates to molecular structures from the Protein Data Bank and the assignment of parameters to biomolecular structures. To address this problem, we have developed the PDB2PQR web service (http://agave.wustl.edu/pdb2pqr/). This server automates many of the common tasks of preparing structures for continuum electrostatics calculations, including adding a limited number of missing heavy atoms to biomolecular structures, estimating titration states and protonating biomolecules in a manner consistent with favorable hydrogen bonding, assigning charge and radius parameters from a variety of force fields, and finally generating 'PQR' output compatible with several popular computational biology packages. This service is intended to facilitate the setup and execution of electrostatics calculations for both experts and non-experts and thereby broaden the accessibility to the biological community of continuum electrostatics analyses of biomolecular systems.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>Continuum electrostatics methods have become increasingly popular due to their ability to provide approximate descriptions of solvation energies and forces without expensive sampling required by explicit solvent models. In particular, the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE) provides electrostatic potentials, solvation energies, and forces by modeling the solvent as a featureless, dielectric material, and the mobile ions as a continuous distribution of charge. Polar solvation forces and energies obtained from the PBE are often supplemented with simple solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) models of nonpolar solvation. Given the recent development of methods that enable the use of PBE and SASA forces in molecular dynamics simulations, it is important to determine the ability of these implicit solvent models to accurately reproduce the solvation forces of more detailed explicit solvent simulations. In this article, we compare PBE and SASA solvation forces with explicit solvent forces for several snapshots from eight trajectories of static conformations of intestinal fatty acid binding protein. The results from this comparison show that current implementations of the PBE are capable of generating polar solvation forces that correlate well with explicit solvent forces but systematically overestimate the magnitude of the interaction. However, SASA-based nonpolar forces are found to have no significant correlation with nonpolar explicit solvent forces. Nevertheless, due to the small magnitude of the nonpolar forces in the current system, a good correlation is still obtained for total solvation forces. The good correlation of implicit solvent forces with more detailed explicit solvent models is encouraging and implies that the systematic errors identified in these models could be corrected by appropriate parameterization of the force fields.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>This chapter presents Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) methods for biomolecular electrostatics. The understanding of electrostatic properties is a basic aspect of the investigation of biomolecular processes. Structures of proteins and other biopolymers are being determined at an increasing rate through structural genomics and other effort. The nonlinear equations obtained from the full PB equation require more specialized techniques, such as Newton methods, to determine the solution to the discretized algebraic equation. The increasing size and number of biomolecular structures have necessitated the development of new parallel finite difference and finite element methods for solving the PB equation. These parallel techniques allow users to leverage supercomputing resources to determine the electrostatic properties of single-structure calculations on large biological systems consisting of millions of atoms. In addition, advances in improving the efficiency of PB force calculations have paved the way for a new era of biomolecular dynamics simulation methods using detailed implicit solvent models. It is anticipated that PB methods will continue to play an important role in computational biology as the study of biological systems grow from macromolecular to cellular scales.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>Microtubules are cylindrical polymers found in every eukaryotic cell. They have a unique helical structure that has implications at both the cellular level, in terms of the functions they perform, and at the multicellular level, such as determining the left-right symmetry in plants. Through the combination of an atomically detailed model for a microtubule and large-scale computational techniques for computing electrostatic interactions, we are able to explain the observed microtubule structure. On the basis of the lateral interactions between protofilaments, we have determined that B lattice is the most favorable configuration. Further, we find that these lateral bonds are significantly weaker than the longitudinal bonds along protofilaments. This explains observations of microtubule disassembly and may serve as another step toward understanding the basis for dynamic instability.</p>

Crystallographic information from a complex of paromomycin with the 30S subunit was used as a framework to develop structures of similar antibiotics in the same ribosomal binding site. Total binding energies were calculated from electrostatic properties obtained by solution of the Poisson−Boltzmann equation combined with a surface area-dependent apolar term. These computed results showed good correlation with experimental data. Additionally, calculation of the ribosomal electrostatic potential in the paromomycin binding site provided insight into the electrostatic mechanisms for aminoglycoside binding and clues for the rational design of more effective antibiotics.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>Evaluation of the electrostatic properties of biomolecules has become a standard practice in molecular biophysics. Foremost among the models used to elucidate the electrostatic potential is the Poisson-Boltzmann equation; however, existing methods for solving this equation have limited the scope of accurate electrostatic calculations to relatively small biomolecular systems. Here we present the application of numerical methods to enable the trivially parallel solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for supramolecular structures that are orders of magnitude larger in size. As a demonstration of this methodology, electrostatic potentials have been calculated for large microtubule and ribosome structures. The results point to the likely role of electrostatics in a variety of activities of these structures.</p>

This paper describes the adaptive multilevel finite element solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for a microtubule on the NPACI Blue Horizon—a massively parallel IBM RS/6000® SP with eight POWER3 SMP nodes. The microtubule system is 40 nm in length and 24 nm in diameter, consists of roughly 600000 atoms, and has a net charge of −1800 e.

                <div class="summary"><p>This article is the first of two articles On the adaptive multilevel finite element treatment of the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE), a nonlinear eliptic equation arising in biomolecular modeling. Fast and accurate numerical solution of the PBE is usually difficult to accomplish, due to the presence of discontinuous coefficients, delta functions, three spatial dimensions, unbounded domain, and rapid (exponential) nonlinearity. In this first article, we explain how adaptive multilevel finite element methods can be used to obtain extremely accurate solutions to the PBE with very modest computational resources, and we present some illustrative examples using two well-known test problems. The PBE is first discretized with piece-wise linear finite elements over a very coarse simplex triangulation of the domain. The resulting nonlinear algebraic equations are solved with global inexact Newton methods, which we have described in an article appearing previously in this journal. A posteriori error estimates are then computed from this discrete solution, which then drives a simplex subdivision algorithm for performing adaptive mesh refinement. The discretize-solve-estimate-refine procedure is then repeated, until a nearly uniform solution quality is obtained. The sequence of unstructured meshes is used to apply multilevel methods in conjunction with global inexact Newton methods, so that the cost of solving the nonlinear algebraic equations at each step approaches optimal O(N) linear complexity. All of the numerical procedures are implemented. in MANIFOLD CODE (MC), a computer program designed and built by the first author over several years at Caltech and UC San Diego. MC is designed to solve a very general class of nonlinear elliptic equations on complicated domains in two and three dimensions. We describe some of the key features of MC, and give a detailed analysis of its performance for two model PBE problems, with comparisons to the alternative methods. It is shown that the best available uniform mesh-based finite difference or box-method algorithms, including multilevel methods, require substantially more time to reach a target PBE solution accuracy than the adaptive multilevel methods in MC. in the second article, we develop an error estimator based on geometric solvent accessibility, and present a series of detailed numerical experiments for several complex biomolecules.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>In order to reduce computational effort and to allow for the use of periodic boundary conditions,electrostatic interactions in explicit solvent simulations of molecular systems do not obey Coulomb’s law. Instead, a number of “effective potentials” have been proposed, including truncated Coulomb, shifted, switched, reaction-field corrected, or Ewald potentials. The present study compares the performance of these schemes in the context of ionic solvation. To this purpose, a generalized form of the Born continuum model for ion solvation is developed, where ion–solvent and solvent–solvent interactions are determined by these effective potentials instead of Coulomb’s law. An integral equation is formulated for calculating the polarization around a spherical ion from which the solvation free energy can be extracted. Comparison of the polarizations and free energies calculated for specific effective potentials and the exact Born result permits an assessment of the accuracy of these different schemes. Additionally, the present formalism can be used to develop corrections to the ionic solvation free energies calculated by molecular simulations implementing such effective potentials. Finally, an arbitrary effective potential is optimized to reproduce the Born polarization.</p>
