Summary: The National Cancer Institute (NCI) National Cancer Informatics Program (NCIP) Nanotechnology Working Group was established for researchers with a specific interest in informatics and computational approaches to nanotechnology, with a particular emphasis on nanomedicine.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) National Cancer Informatics Program (NCIP) Nanotechnology Working Group was established in 2008 for researchers with a specific interest in informatics and computational approaches to nanotechnology, with a particular emphasis on nanomedicine. The goal of this working group is to demonstrate the scientific potential of federating nanotechnology databases through pilot projects aimed at integrated semantic search and retrieval of nanomedicine and nanotoxicology datasets that are applicable across nanoscience. The NCIP Nanotechnology Working Group (NCIP Nano WG) comprises over 20 active participants from academia, government and industry with diverse interests.
