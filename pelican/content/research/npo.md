Summary: The NanoParticle Ontology was developed to help share and analyze data from cancer nanotechnology research.

The [NanoParticle Ontology](http://www.nano-ontology.org/) was developed to help share and analyze data from cancer nanotechnology research.

Data generated from cancer nanotechnology research are so diverse and large in volume that it is difficult to share and efficiently use them without informatics tools. In particular, ontologies that provide a unifying knowledge framework for annotating the data are required to facilitate the semantic integration, knowledge-based searching, unambiguous interpretation, mining and inferencing of the data using informatics methods. Here, we discuss the design and development of NanoParticle Ontology (NPO), which is developed within the framework of the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), and implemented in the Ontology Web Language (OWL) using well-defined ontology design principles. The NPO is developed to represent the knowledge underlying the description, preparation, and characterization of nanomaterials in cancer nanotechnology research.

This development was supported by the NIH through grants U54 CA119342 and U54 HG004028.  Currently, the NCI caBIG Nanotechnology Working Group supports the development and use of the NanoParticle Ontology.
