RNA folding and binding reactions are mediated by interactions with ions that make up the surrounding aqueous electrolytic milieu. Although Mg(2+) ions are often implicated as being crucial for RNA folding, it is known that folding is feasible in high concentrations of monovalent alkali-halide salts. Experiments have yielded important information regarding the salt dependence of RNA stability. Recent work has shown that molecular simulations based on explicit representations of solvent molecules and monovalent ions can also provide useful insights regarding the ionic atmospheres around model RNA systems. These insights can help rationalize intriguing observations regarding the dependence of RNA stability on cation type providing one pays attention to important considerations that go into the proper design of molecular simulations. These issues are discussed in detail and the methods are applied to an A-form RNA and B-form DNA sequence. The results of these simulations are compared to previous work on a kissing-loop system with analogous sequence. In particular, ionic atmospheres obtained from molecular simulations are compared to those obtained using the nonlinear Poisson Boltzmann model for continuum electrostatics for these three different nucleic acid systems. The comparisons indicate reasonable agreement in terms of coarse-grained observables such as the numbers of counterions accumulated around the solutes. However, details of the ionic atmospheres, captured in terms of spatial free energy density profiles, are quite different between the two approaches. These comparisons suggest the need for improvements in continuum models to capture sequence-specific effects, ion-ion correlation, and the effects of partial dehydration of ions.
