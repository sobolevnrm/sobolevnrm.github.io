Chapter 5 covers biomolecular applications of the Poisson-Boltzmann Equation (PBE). An introduction to biomolecular electrostatics is first given, where the factors influencing long-range electric interactions during molecular simulations are highlighted. A perspective of explicit versus implicit aqueous environments is presented and a historical account of implicit solvent methods is given. Warnings about when not to use such simplifications are stressed and situations where implicit solvent treatments are applicable are presented. How to treat polar and nonpolar interactions is given next; leading references to scaled particle theory methods, solvent accessible surface area methods and the like are abundant in this chapter. Following a brief overview of the PBE, the author describes for the novice modeler the methods commonly used to solve it with a major emphasis placed on discretization techniques including finite difference, boundary element, and finite element methods. Multilevel solvers, and parallel methods for solving the PBE are also presented and a list of available software for computational electrostatics is given. The author then takes the reader through applications of PB methods to determine solvation free energies, conformational free energies, binding free energies, titration calculations and other applications.
