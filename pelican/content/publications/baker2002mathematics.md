Advances in mathematics and computer technology, together with advances in structural biology, are opening the way to detailed modeling of biology at the molecular and cellular levels. One objective of such studies is the development of a more complete understanding of biological systems, including the emergence of behavior at the cellular level from that at the molecular level. Another objective is the development of more sophisticated models for structure-aided discovery of new pharmaceuticals.
