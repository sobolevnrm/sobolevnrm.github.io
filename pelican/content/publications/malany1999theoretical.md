The role of electrostatics in the function of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) has been investigated by both theoretical and experimental approaches. Second-order rate constants (kE=kcat/Km) for acetylthiocholine (ATCh) turnover have been measured as a function of ionic strength of the reaction medium for wild-type and mutant AChEs. Also, binding and dissociation rate constants have been measured as a function of ionic strength for the respective charged and neutral transition state analog inhibitors m-(N,N,N-trimethylammonio)trifluoroacetophenone (TMTFA) and m-(t-butyl)trifluoroacetophenone (TBTFA). Linear free-energy correlations between catalytic rate constants and inhibition constants indicate that kE for ATCh turnover is rate limited by terminal binding events. Comparison of binding rate constants for TMTFA and TBTFA attests to the sizable electrostatic discrimination of AChE. Free energy profiles for cationic ligand release from the active sites of wild-type and mutant AChEs have been calculated via a model that utilizes the structure of T. californica AChE, a spherical ligand, and energy terms that account for electrostatic and van der Waals interactions and chemical potential. These calculations indicate that EA and EI complexes are not bound with respect to electrostatic interactions, which obviates the need for a ‘back door’ for cationic ligand release. Moreover, the computed energy barriers for ligand release give linear free-energy correlations with log(kE) for substrate turnover, which supports the general correctness of the computational model.
