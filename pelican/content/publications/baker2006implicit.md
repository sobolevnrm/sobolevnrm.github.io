We give an overview of how implicit solvent models are currently used in protein simulations. The emphasis is on numerical algorithms and approximations: since even folded proteins sample many distinct configurations, it is of considerable importance to be both accurate and efficient in estimating the energetic consequences of this dynamical behavior. Particular attention is paid to calculations of pH-dependent behavior, as a paradigm for the analysis of electrostatic interactions in complex systems.
